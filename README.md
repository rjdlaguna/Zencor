# Zencor Agricultural Website

## Project Overview

The **Zencor Agricultural Website** is a marketing and educational platform designed to provide farmers with crop protection insights, agricultural solutions, and product updates.

# Backend Setup Instructions

The backend server handles **user registration, login authentication, and retrieving registered users**.

## Step 1 — Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js (LTS version):

https://nodejs.org

After installation, verify Node.js is installed correctly by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Step 2 — Navigate to the Backend Folder

Open **Git Bash, Terminal, or Command Prompt** and run:

```
cd zencor-backend
```

---

## Step 3 — Initialize the Node.js Project

If running the backend for the first time, initialize the Node.js project:

```
npm init -y
```

This creates the file:

```
package.json
```

---

## Step 4 — Install Required Dependencies

Install the backend libraries required to run the server:

```
npm install express cors
```

This installs:

* **Express** — Node.js web server framework
* **CORS** — Allows communication between frontend and backend

Running this command will create:

```
node_modules
package-lock.json
```

---

## Step 5 — Start the Backend Server

Run the backend server using:

```
node server.js
```

If the server starts successfully, the terminal will display:

```
Zencor user system running on port 3000
```

The backend server will run at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# Backend API Routes

The backend provides the following API endpoints.

### Register User

```
POST /signup
```

Stores a new registered user in the database.

---

### Login User

```
POST /login
```

Authenticates a registered user's login credentials.

---

### Retrieve Registered Users

```
GET /users
```

Returns all registered users for the admin dashboard.

---

# Database

Registered users are stored in a JSON file:

```
users.json
```

Example database structure:

```
[
  {
    "firstName": "Aira",
    "lastName": "Rosal",
    "email": "aira@test.com",
    "password": "123456",
    "dateRegistered": "2026-03-14"
  }
]
```

---

# Running the Website

1. Start the backend server:

```
node server.js
```

2. Open the website by launching:

```
index.html
```

3. Register a user through:

```
signup.html
```

4. Login using:

```
login.html
```

5. View registered users through the admin dashboard:

```
admin.html
```

---

# Important Notes

Do **not upload the `node_modules` folder** to GitHub because it is very large.

Anyone running the project can recreate it by installing dependencies with:

```
npm install express cors
```

# Purpose of the System

* SEO optimization
* User engagement tracking
